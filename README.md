# WayVocab

A vocabulary learning tool based on Java Swing, and only works on Windows.

This was written a long time ago in my early high school years, and had not been maintained for years.

The most unique feature of this vocab tool is the transparent mode where you can watch video and learn vocab on the same screen at the same time.
